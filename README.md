📚 Bookstore Microservices (DevOps Project)

A cloud-native Bookstore application built with a microservices architecture, containerized deployments, and production-ready AWS infrastructure.

This project demonstrates end-to-end DevOps practices:

Microservices with Docker

CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins

Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Secure deployments on AWS ECS Fargate with RDS

Monitoring and observability with CloudWatch

🚀 Architecture Overview

Key Components:

Frontend → React + Nginx, behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Backend Services → Node.js microservices:

📘 Catalog Service (book metadata & inventory)

📦 Orders Service (order management)

💳 Payments Service (transaction handling)

Databases → PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS (one per service, private subnets, multi-AZ)

Container Registry → Amazon ECR

CI/CD → Jenkins pipelines (build → test → dockerize → push → deploy)

Networking & Security → Multi-AZ VPC, subnets, NAT Gateway, IAM, Secrets Manager

Observability → CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, Alarms

🛠️ Local Development

Run everything locally with Docker Compose:

docker-compose up --build


Services:

Frontend → http://localhost:3000

Catalog → http://localhost:3001

Orders → http://localhost:3002

Payments → http://localhost:3003

🔧 CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

  B --> C[Run Tests]
  C --> D[Build Docker Image]
  D --> E[Push to ECR]
  E --> F[Terraform Apply]
  F --> G[ECS Fargate Deployment]


Each microservice includes a Jenkinsfile:

Checkout → Pull code

Install & Test → npm ci && npm test

Build & Push → Docker image to ECR

Deploy → Terraform updates ECS service

🌐 Infrastructure (Terraform)

Infrastructure is fully automated using Terraform.

Modules

VPC → Multi-AZ, public/private subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway

ECS Cluster → Fargate tasks, services, IAM roles

ECR → Private container registries

ALB → Path-based routing for services

IAM → Roles and policies with least-privilege

RDS → PostgreSQL (multi-AZ, backups, security groups, Secrets Manager)

Environments

terraform/environments/dev → Dev environment

terraform/environments/prod → Production environment

Deploy with:

cd terraform/environments/prod
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

📊 Monitoring & Security

Logs → CloudWatch Logs (per service log group)

Metrics & Alerts → CPU, memory, error rates

High Availability → ECS auto-healing, RDS Multi-AZ failover

Security →

IAM roles per service

AWS Secrets Manager for DB creds

Security Groups with least access
