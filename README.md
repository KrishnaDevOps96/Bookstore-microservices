# Bookstore Microservices (DevOps Project)

A cloud-native Bookstore application built with a **microservices architecture**, containerized deployments, and production-ready **AWS infrastructure**.

This project demonstrates end-to-end **DevOps practices**:

- Microservices with **Docker**
- CI/CD pipelines using **Jenkins**
- Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform**
- Secure deployments on **AWS ECS Fargate with RDS**
- Monitoring and observability with **CloudWatch**

---

## Architecture Overview

### Key Components
- **Frontend** → React + Nginx, behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)  
- **Backend Services** → Node.js microservices:
  - **Catalog Service** (book metadata & inventory)  
  - **Orders Service** (order management)  
  - **Payments Service** (transaction handling)  
- **Databases** → PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS (one per service, private subnets, multi-AZ)  
- **Container Registry** → Amazon ECR  
- **CI/CD** → Jenkins pipelines (build → test → dockerize → push → deploy)  
- **Networking & Security** → Multi-AZ VPC, subnets, NAT Gateway, IAM, Secrets Manager  
- **Observability** → CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, Alarms

## Traffic Flow
Browsing Books
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant FE as Frontend
  participant ALB
  participant C as Catalog Service
  participant DB as Catalog DB

  User->>FE: bookstore.example.com
  FE->>ALB: GET /api/catalog/books
  ALB->>C: Forward request
  C->>DB: Query books
  DB-->>C: Return data
  C-->>FE: JSON Response
  FE-->>User: Display books
```
## Placing an Order
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant ALB
  participant O as Orders Service
  participant P as Payments Service
  participant DBO as Orders DB
  participant DBP as Payments DB

  User->>ALB: POST /api/orders
  ALB->>O: Orders Service
  O->>DBO: Save Order
  O->>ALB: Call /api/payments
  ALB->>P: Payments Service
  P->>DBP: Save Payment
  P-->>User: Payment success
  O-->>User: Order confirmed
```
## Local Development

Run everything locally with Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
**Services**

- Frontend → http://localhost:3000
- Catalog → http://localhost:3001
- Orders → http://localhost:3002
- Payments → http://localhost:3003

## CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Git Push] --> B[Jenkins Pipeline]
  B --> C[Run Tests]
  C --> D[Build Docker Image]
  D --> E[Push to ECR]
  E --> F[Terraform Apply]
  F --> G[ECS Fargate Deployment]
```

Each microservice includes a Jenkinsfile:

- **Checkout** → Pull code
- **Install** & Test → npm ci && npm test
- **Build & Push** → Docker image to ECR
- **Deploy** → Terraform updates ECS service

## Infrastructure (Terraform)

Infrastructure is fully automated using Terraform.

Modules

- **VPC** → Multi-AZ, public/private subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway
- **ECS** Cluster → Fargate tasks, services, IAM roles
- **ECR** → Private container registries
- **ALB** → Path-based routing for services
- **IAM** → Roles and policies with least-privilege
- **RDS** → PostgreSQL (multi-AZ, backups, security groups, Secrets Manager)

Environments
- ```terraform/environments/dev``` → Development environment

- ```terraform/environments/prod``` → Production environment

Deploy with:
```
cd terraform/environments/prod
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Monitoring & Security

- Logs → CloudWatch Logs (per service log group)
- Metrics & Alerts → CPU, memory, error rates
- High Availability → ECS auto-healing, RDS Multi-AZ failover
- Security:
  - IAM roles per service
  - AWS Secrets Manager for DB creds
  - Security Groups with least access
